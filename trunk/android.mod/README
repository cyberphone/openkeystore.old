Android: Xerces and Webpki port
===============================

If you only want to validate XML documents using Schemas
you just download this project and do "ant".  The resulting
JAR for dropping into the "libs" section of an Android project
will be called "dist/xerces-android.mod.jar".

Due to the fact that Android (at least with JB 4.1) does not support
standard methods for adding XML parsers you need to do the following:

DocumentBuilderFactory dbf =
   DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance ("org.webpki.android.org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl",
   TheClassThatIsUsingTheLibrary.class.getClassLoader ());
   
SchemaFactory sf = SchemaFactory.newInstance (XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI, 
       "org.webpki.android.org.apache.xerces.jaxp.validation.XMLSchemaFactory",
       TheClassThatIsUsingTheLibrary.class.getClassLoader ());
   
Now you should be able to follow the Java standard for XML validation!
